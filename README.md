This fork adds the ablity to use an external database instead of a local SQLite3 database. PostgreSQL has been added first but MySQL/MariaDB is possible also using either database driver MySQLdb or pymysql.

In order to use this plugin with PostgreSQL, the database driver psycopg2 must be installed in the Python environment you are running OctoPrint in. ex:

```../venv37/pip install psycopg2```

The OctoPrint-Plugin stores all print-job informations of a print in a local database.
These informations were collected from OctoPrint itself, but also from other plugins. See [below](#Optional-Plugins) for more information about these plugins.

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-PrintJobHistory/releases/latest/download/master.zip

After installation, you can listen on three release channels (since 1.6.0).
What does this mean: Each channel has its own release-version and each release has a different kind of functionality and stability.

- **"Only Release"**: Only stable and tested versions will be shown in the software-update section of OctoPrint
- **"Release & Candidate"**: Beside the stable release, you can also see the "release-candidates", like '''1.7.0rc3'''.
  The rc's includde new functionalty/bugfixes and are already tested by the community.. so by YOU ;-)
- **"Release & Candidate & in Development"**: Beside stable and rc, you will be informed about development versions.
  A development version like '''1.8.0.dev5``` could include a new (experimental) feature/bugfixs, but it is not fully tested by the community

Changing between each release is done via the "Software Update section" in the settings.
![release-channels](screenshots/release-channels.png "Release channels")

**!!! If you use the development-channel, you can use the latest feature and can improve the quality of the plugin !!!**

Hint: "Easy-switching" is possible with OctoPrint-Version 1.8.0 (see https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4238).
At the meantime you need to uninstall and install the version you like from the selected channel...or stay in one channel ;-)
